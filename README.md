**A curated list of hacking environments where you can train your cyber skills legally and safely**

![](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAg_AAAAJDE0NmI0OGMzLTcyYTUtNGJhMS1iZjM4LWRmYzEwODM0ZWFhNg.jpg)

For everyone in the Information Security business, it's important to understand the enemy, the hacker. Understanding the enemy makes you the best defender you can be to secure the digital world.

> By knowing your enemy, you can defeat your enemy. 

In the USA, the most senior police officers, even long after their pension, are advising residents how to secure their homes better. They come to your house and tell you where your weak points are around the house. They can advise this because they KNOW their enemy, the criminal that wants to break into the house and his techniques.

Training your cyber skills means also keeping your hacking skills up to date. To do this, you need an environment to practice in, legally and safely.

For this purpose, I have made a list of websites you can visit and practice your cyber skills. Every site has a different angle on the whole thing, so I'll summarize in a couple of words its specifics.

Some sites will offer you tutorials to help you, others will require you to find things on your own.

I will update this post below regularly and add sites to this post so bookmark it and/or follow me to see the latest overview. 

If you are missing a site not mentioned in the list, feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/joe-shenouda/awesome-cyber-skills/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING).

[Joe Shenouda](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/josephshenouda) has extensive experience in IT, ICS & Information Security as an international hands-on technical engineer, trainer, consultant & research fellow with a successful record in developing & leading technical corporate Cybersecurity programs for military & global organizations.

Joe uses risk management in the planning phase while implementing the correct defense measures at the right place & has lead teams doing that. He has done 100-s of security assessments & audits for numerous customers.

Apart from vulnerability assessments, Joe gives LIVE hack shows where, w̲i̲t̲h̲ ̲y̲o̲u̲r̲ ̲p̲e̲r̲m̲i̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲, he will take over a server/computer, a phone or hack everyone in the room in one hit, without hurting anyone. 

Using the latest hacking techniques, he will also educate the audience to explain what just happened. Joe uses Man-in-the-Middle attacks, ARP Poisoning, Sniffing, Script injections, DNS spoofing & hijacks sessions that are happening on devices & explains how to prevent them in a LIVE setting. 

He can also simulate a DOS attack that brings the strongest networks down. 

Well known in The Netherlands as "The Netdetective", Joe presented an MTV show on hacking for young adults.

He started his Information Security career at Tilburg University in 1999 where he did research on Cybersecurity, Cybercrime, cyber forensics, privacy & data protection. 

He has a strong expertise in concept & cyber security architecture development with a lot of hands-on technical experience in cybersecurity systems. Joe was responsible for significant research work through OSINT & Darknet intel & he was the lead responsible for numerous Information Assurance projects that involved cybersecurity approaches & systems for detection, prevention, & mitigation of malicious activity. 

Joe also spoke frequently on cyber security & hacking at professional conferences & published articles & blogs on issues relating to cybersecurity.

Security Cleared for several projects.
