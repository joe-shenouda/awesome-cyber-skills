# awesome-cyber-skills
**A curated list of hacking environments where you can train your cyber skills free, legally and safely**

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24913656/230711515-f0848676-f967-4690-9914-40646ec40c4a.png)

## About the List

In the field of Information Security, understanding the enemy, the hacker, is crucial. By knowing your enemy, you can effectively defend and secure the digital world.

> "Know the enemy, and you can defeat the enemy."

In the USA, even high-ranking retired police officers continue to advise residents on how to better secure their homes. They visit houses and identify weak points, sharing their knowledge of the criminals' techniques to help prevent break-ins.

To hone your cybersecurity skills, you need to keep your hacking skills up-to-date. To achieve this, a safe, legal, and free environment is necessary for practice.

This list compiles websites that offer various opportunities to practice your cyber skills. Each site has a unique approach, and a brief description is provided to highlight its focus.

Some sites offer tutorials to guide you, while others encourage self-directed exploration.

This post will be regularly updated with new sites, so bookmark it or follow me to stay informed with the latest overview.
